'''
Big data sets are often stored, or extracted as JSON.

JSON is plain text, but has the format of an object, and is well known in 
the world of programming, including Pandas.

In our examples we will be using a JSON file called 'data.json'.



'''

import pandas as pd 


# To this:
abj = pd.read_json(r"C:\Python learning\Python concepts + Libraries\#11 Pandas Library\Basics of Panda\Panda_read_it .JSON")

print(abj.to_string())




# It work same as Python Dictionary
